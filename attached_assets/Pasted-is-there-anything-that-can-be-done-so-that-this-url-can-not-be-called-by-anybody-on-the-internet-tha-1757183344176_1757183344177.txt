is there anything that can be done so that this url can not be called by anybody on the internet that decides on trying it?  https://selling-options-lab.com/admin

Yes—lock it down at two layers:

1) App layer (Flask): only signed-in admins

You already have this—just turn it back on.

@app.route('/admin')
@admin_required   # <-- re-enable this
def admin_dashboard():
    ...


Do the same for every admin route (/admin/*). Also harden cookies:

app.config.update(
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax',
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True,  # if behind HTTPS
)


This stops non-admins/anonymous users even if they reach the endpoint.

2) Edge layer (Caddy): block the URL from the public internet

Since you’re using Caddy in Docker on the NAS, add one of these guards in your /volume1/docker/selling-options-lab/Caddyfile and reload Caddy.

Option A — IP allowlist (strongest & simple)

Only allow your home IP (replace with yours) and local LAN. Everyone else gets 403.

:80 {
  encode zstd gzip
  header X-Env LAB
  @admin path /admin* /admin/* 
  @notallowed not remote_ip 73.23.45.67/32 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8
  handle @admin {
    respond @notallowed 403
    reverse_proxy app:5000
  }
  reverse_proxy app:5000
}


Tip: if your home IP is dynamic, consider a small /29 from your ISP or use a VPN option below.

Option B — HTTP Basic Auth on /admin (quick & reliable)

Prompt for a second password before Flask ever sees the request.

Generate a hash (on the NAS):

docker exec -it selling-options-lab-caddy-1 caddy hash-password --plaintext 'STRONG_ADMIN_PASSWORD'


Caddyfile:

:80 {
  encode zstd gzip
  header X-Env LAB
  @admin path /admin* /admin/*
  handle @admin {
    basicauth {
      lou JDJhJDEw$...paste-hash-here...
    }
    reverse_proxy app:5000
  }
  reverse_proxy app:5000
}

Option C — Put admin on a private subdomain + allowlist

Keep the public site open, but move admin to a host only you can reach.

selling-options-lab.com {
  encode zstd gzip
  reverse_proxy app:5000
}

admin.selling-options-lab.com {
  encode zstd gzip
  @notallowed not remote_ip 73.23.45.67/32 192.168.0.0/16
  respond @notallowed 403
  reverse_proxy app:5000
}


Point only your home/VPN DNS to admin.selling-options-lab.com.

Option D — Zero-trust/VPN (best long-term)

Tailscale/WireGuard: expose /admin only on the tailnet address.

Or Cloudflare Access: require SSO (Google/Microsoft) before Caddy sees it.

Don’t forget

Remove the temporary # @admin_required # Temporarily disabled for testing comments across admin routes.

Return 404 for admin paths if you want to “hide” it:

respond @notallowed 404


“robots.txt/noindex” ≠ security. Use the methods above.

After editing the Caddyfile:

cd /volume1/docker/selling-options-lab
docker compose exec caddy caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
docker compose restart caddy


If you tell me your preferred approach (IP allowlist, basic auth, or private subdomain), I’ll tailor the exact Caddyfile for your lab/prod stacks and include the precise commands for your directory layout.
